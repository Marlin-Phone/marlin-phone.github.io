# About Me

Hi, I'm Ma Lingfeng. During high school, a friend gave me the nickname `Marlin` based on the homophonic sound of my name. I found it fitting and have used it ever since.

## Profile

Currently a sophomore majoring in Computer Science and Technology at `Shaanxi University of Science & Technology`, systematically building my computer science knowledge system. Current learning roadmap:

### Knowledge Graph Construction
- [x] Computer Networks (Completed Feb 14, 2025)
- [ ] Computer Organization and Principles (Expected: March 2025)
- [ ] Database Systems (Expected: May 2025)
- [ ] In-depth study of CSAPP (with ongoing Lab exercises)

### Skills Forge
- [ ] Independent development of personal blog system (React + Node.js)
- [ ] Open-source contributions (Aim to submit first PR by April 2025)
- [x] Technical blog established (3 original articles published)
- [ ] Algorithm practice (Target: Lanqiao Cup Provincial First Prize level by mid-April 2025 | 108 problems solved on Luogu)

### Milestones
- 🏆 National College Student Mathematical Modeling Contest (Shaanxi Division First Prize)
- 💻 Lanqiao Cup C/C++ Programming Competition (Provincial Third Prize)
- 🚧 Participated in 2025 MCM/ICM (Results pending)

*(Progress: 20%...) Compared to outstanding developers of my age, this is just the beginning. Preparing to challenge more hardcore competitions in 2025.*
